<p align="center"> This uses the Spotify APIs to create a playlist.  You choose up to 5 songs and then generate a recommended playlist that you can save to Spotify.  You can listen to songs to help determine if you want to include them.

## üéà What did I learn? <a name="learnings"></a>
This was one of my first React projects so I learned loads about API calls, lifting up state, the overall idea of components.  Really fun project because I kept getting to hear different music.

## üéà Todos <a name="todos"></a>
Things that I would have loved to do:
- Improve the music player (currently using a library).  Would make my own and improve the look and feel.
- Release this for use.  Given Spotify restrictions, that isn't currently possible (they don't allow API calls outside of development for projects).
- Used Redux or some other state manager
